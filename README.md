# Duck Time - A simple screen-time in the menu bar.

This is a super-simple screen-time that gets placed in the menu-bar.
It counts all non-idle time for each day and each week starting
on Sundays.  I use it with swiftbar on my work computer to get an
idea of my work screen-time.

## Why "Duck" Time?

There is no good reason.  I chose bonafide duck as my username
years ago and am trying to *brand* my work with ducks.

# Configuration

The configuraton is saved in ~/.config/xbar-ducktime.json.
Currently, this is also used as the data storage to track
the time.
